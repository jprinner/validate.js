# validate.js
An alternative to Mailchimp's src='//s3.amazonaws.com/downloads.mailchimp.com/js/mc-validate.js' that does not include the jquery library (for solving conflicts in Wordpress Themes).

Instead of including <script type='text/javascript' src='//s3.amazonaws.com/downloads.mailchimp.com/js/mc-validate.js'></script> just upload and enqueue this validate.js file.
